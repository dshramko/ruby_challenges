## Bubble sort

 Sorting algorithms are one of the common domains for studying Computer Science data structures and algorithms. The most straight forward is Bubble Sort. 
 
 **Description**

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm. This sorting algorithm is comparison based algorithm in which each pair of adjacent elements is compared and elements are swapped if they are not in order. This algorithm does sorting in-place i.e. it does not creates a new array while carrying out the sorting process. 

**Inputs & Outputs**

*Input description*

Start with unsorted array = [5, 1, 4, 2, 8]

*Output description*  

Sorted array = [1, 2, 4, 5, 8]
