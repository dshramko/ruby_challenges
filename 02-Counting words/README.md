## Counting words

 Given a file, we should read it and parse the data.
 
 * Read the prophet.txt file and display a count of the most commonly used words in the document.
 * Output should consist of a Hash - key-value pair of the word and its word count.
 * Output should be case insensitive
   
 **Optional**
 * limit a number of commonly used words to show.
 * Don't count grammar words - the, a, and, to, of, etc
 
 **Example**
 
 "This is a cat. The cat is black"
 
 {  
   "is": 2,  
   "cat":	2,  
   "this": 1,  
   "a": 1,  
   "the": 1,  
   "black": 1  
 }
